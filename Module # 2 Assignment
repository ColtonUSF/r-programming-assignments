assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}
# When the above code is run in RStudio, I am met with the error code "Error in myMean(): object 'assignment' not found."
# The reason for this is that when creating the "myMean" function, "assignment" was used instead of "assignment2" and the "someData" variable does not even exist.
# Here is the correct code for the function 
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}
# The function now returns 19.25 in the console
